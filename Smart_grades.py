# This is a system made to take user inputs of grades and output average (% + Letter grade)
# We need to be able to strip input of any stuff we do not want

#Plan: Get input from user, strip of jargon using regex, put numbers obtained into a dictionary [English: 98%]
#Add values in dictionary together and calculate (find number of values based on for loop)
# Correlate average % to letter grade using if statements. 
# output in string format

#Declare any libraries needed (regex)

# create function that does the following: 
    # declare input

    # use regex to clean input to get respect grades

    # use numbers in list, add them up, and calculate the average "for num in list, total_num + num" and then calculate by dividing by amount of numbers
    #Also find highest and lowest using min() and max() function

    #Associate calculated average with letter grades

    #output grades with letter
